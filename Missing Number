Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

For example,
Given nums = [0, 1, 3] return 2.

Note:
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?



public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int result = nums.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            result ^= i;
            result ^= nums[i];
        }
        return result;
    }
